I am currently a second-year graduate student at the Research Center of Logistics, [College of Economic and Social Development](https://esd.nankai.edu.cn/index.htm), [Nankai University](https://www.nankai.edu.cn/main.htm) since 2023 fall advised by [Prof. Jianhua Xiao](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37674908800). A downloadable version of my CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AV7PURCm7uvJ4VMM53uLpO1mVNQSUnwc/view?usp=sharing).

My research interests involve using **distributionally robust optimization (DRO)**, **target-based risk management**, and **algorithms** to assist **data-driven decision-making under uncertainty**. Specifically, my focus areas include:

- **Data-driven Decision-making**: Robust Satisficing, DRO, the interface of predictive and prescriptive analytics  
- **Smart City Operations**: Vehicle sharing, inventory repositioning, battery swapping, and dynamic pricing

During September 2019-June 2023, I earned my B.Mgmt. in Industrial Engineering from [College of Economics and Managment](https://cem.nuaa.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)](https://nuaa.edu.cn/). I received the [University Achievement Award](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/6FwrrZdFe_X89ytALFYzFQ), **the highest honor for undergraduate students** in NUAA, recognizing outstanding graduates for excellence in academics, innovation and leadership.
