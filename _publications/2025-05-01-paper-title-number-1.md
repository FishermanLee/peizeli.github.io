excerpt: 'This research aims to address the battery inventory management problem with uncertain demand that arises in an EV battery swapping-charging network. In this problem, decision-makers determine initial battery stocks and periodic network operations, including battery replenishment, fulfillment, and lateral transshipment. To tackle the curse of dimensionality and distributional ambiguity, we propose a utility-based Service Level Measure (SLM) and incorporate this measure to derive a target-oriented Robust Satisficing (RS) model. A rigorous mathematical proof is provided for the salient properties of the SLM and RS models. This work pioneers the examination of multi-stage robust decisions under novel RS framework.'

# Abstract

Battery swapping for refueling has been embraced by major electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers. To facilitate the operations of battery swapping, this paper studies the management of a battery swapping network that operates in a ”*swap locally, charge-centrally*” way: batteries are swapped at local swapping stations and transported to a central charging station for recharging. It remains unclear how to replenish batteries from central charging stations, fulfill uncertain demand, and trans ship batteries among swapping stations to guarantee a high service level. In this paper, we exploit the network as a repairable inventory management problem with lateral transshipment. Combining the ideas from process flexibility, we first develop a stochastic dynamic program to characterize coupling network operations. Then we introduce a novel *robust satisficing model* from a target-oriented perspective to address the curse of dimensionality and distributional ambiguity. Specifically, we first employ a *utility-based Service Level Measure* by constraining the severity of inventory violations caused by uncertain demand. We solve this problem by leveraging an *event-wise ambiguity set* and a pooling-group-based *enhanced linear decision rule*. Out-of-sample tests demonstrate that our model outperforms several benchmarks in terms of robust ness and target attainment. The major insights are twofold: (i) Incorporating lateral transshipment in the service network reduces substantial costs compared to a system without transshipment. Furthermore, a chaining network captures most of the bene f its of a fully flexible network, and (ii) increasing the cost budget can enhance the robustness, whereas increasing the penalty cost reduces the probability of inventory violation by building more battery inventory.
